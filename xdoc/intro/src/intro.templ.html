<h1>xbuild introduction</h1>
<i>xbuild</i> is inspired by <a href="http://pydoit.org">pydoit</a>. Unfortunately pydoit is not really able to handle
<a href="https://github.com/pydoit/doit/issues/127">code generators</a>. <i>xbuild</i>'s main aim is to keep the simplicity of
<i>pydoit</i> and to provide a solution for the code generators.

<p><i>xbuild</i> provides a minimalistic API. Contrary to <i>scons</i> or <i>make</i> it doesn't provide any high level patterns
and gypsy-magics like pattern rules or environments.
<i>xbuild</i> is python based. Python is a feature rich and popular scripting language, which allows you to programatically build up the
dependency graph in many different ways. It has also thousands of useful, easy to use modules which can help a lot. With <i>xbuild</i>
you can use your own patterns for your build system.</p>

<p>In <i>xbuild</i> the main dependency graph entity is the <b>Task</b>. A <i>task</i> may have <i>targets</i> and <i>dependencies</i>.
<i>Targets</i> are always files. The <i>dependencies</i> can be files or other <i>Tasks</i>.The <i>Task</i> constructor has
arguments which accepts function references, here are them:
<ul>
<li><i>upToDate</i> is executed when the
<i>Task</i> is requested and all of its dependencies are up-to-date. It must return <i>True</i> when the task is up-to-date, or
<i>False</i> when it is not up-to-date. In case of error it must return with an <i>int</i> or throw an <i>Exception</i>. A default
method is provided, it is named <i>targetUpToDate</i>. It is good for most cases. When you implement your own up-to-date method, it is
a good practice to call <i>targetUpToDate</i> in the beginning, and do your costum checks only when <i>targetUpToDate</i> returned
<i>True</i>.</li>

<li><i>action</i> is executed when the <i>Task</i> is requested and it is up-to-date (dependencies are up-to-date and the
<i>upToDate</i> function returned <i>True</i>). It must do the "real stuff", like compilation, linking, etc. It must return <i>0</i>
on success or a non-zero <i>int</i> in case of error.</li>

<li><i>taskFactory</i>. It has to be passed for generator tasks, when the generated files needs some post-compilation. This function has
to create tasks for compiling the generated files. See examples below.</li>

<li><i>dynFileDepFetcher</i>. Dynamic File Dependency Fetcher. It needs to be passed for a task if it depends on a generator task.
This method tells that which generated files needed for the task. It has a default implementation but in most cases you have to provide
your own implementation.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The main API class is the <b>Builder</b>. Here are its most important functions:
</p>

<h2>Simple example for concatenating files.</h2>
<!-- includePython: xtest/example_basic0.py -->

<p>Note that the file system is accessed via the <i>fs</i> object. It makes possible easy mocking and mapping non file system resources
as file system resources in <i>python</i> level.</p>
<p>Here is the visual representation of the example task.</p>

<h2>Code generator tasks</h2>

<h3>Simple case - generated files are used directly.</h3>
<p>The generated code is used directly by the parent task.</p>

<!-- includePython: xtest/example_gen0.py -->
<p>Here is the before-build dependency graph.</p>
<img src="gen0.before.png"/>
<p>Here is the after-build dependency graph.</p>
<img src="gen0.png"/>
<p>Note: if a generator generates a lot of unused temporary files (garbage) that would slow down the up-to-date checks and would result
ugly/bloated PlantUML generation. In the future it would worth to register only the useful files as <i>generatedFiles</i> and register
the remaining files as <i>garbage</i>. <i>garbage</i> would be considered only at <i>clean</i> execution.</p>

<h3>More complex case - generated files needs compilation</h3>
<p>The generated code needs some compilation before it is used by the parent task. E.g. the generator creates <i>.c</i> files, bud the parent
task (e.g. linker) needs compiled  <i>.o</i> files. In this case the generator task needs to fill the <i>providedFiles</i> field with the
<i>.o</i> files. At task creation the <i>taskFactory</i> argument have to be passed. <i>taskFactory</i> is a reference to a function
which must return a list of tasks for building the provided files.</p>
<p>In the following example the generator creates <i>.txt</i> files. Its parent task creates a file which contains the size of every
<i>.txt</i> files. For this the generator task will provide <i>.size</i> files for every <i>.txt</i> files. The <i>.size</i> files
are built by tasks which are created by the generator's <i>sizeTaskFactory</i> function.</p>

<!-- includePython: xtest/example_gen1.py -->
<p>The before-build dependency graph is simple:</p>
<img src='gen1.before.png'/>
<p>And here is the after-build dependency graph:</p>
<img src='gen1.png'/>

<h4>The <i>dynFileDepFetcher</i> task callback</h4>

<p>A generator can generate many kind of files. And the different kind of files need to be supplied for different kind of parent tasks.
For example a generator can generate <i>.c</i> and <i>.json</i> files. One parent task is a linker, it needs the compiled <i>.o</i>
files, the other parent task is a document builder and that needs <i>.xml</i> files built from the <i>.json</i> files.</p>
<p>In <i>xbuild</i> this is solved by the <i>dynFileDepFetcher</i> task callback method. This method must be passed to the parent
tasks of the generators. This method simply selects that which generated or provided files are needed from the generator task.</p>
<p>The default method is this:</p>
<!-- includePython: xdoc/intro/src/fetchAllDynFileDeps.py.txt -->
<p>In most cases you have to provide your own implementation. It is simple. The method gets a generator task and you have to return
the generated and provided files needed for the parent task.</p>
<p>In the above code example this is used:</p>
<pre>dynFileDepFetcher=FetchDynFileDeps(fetchProv=True)</pre>
<p><i>FetchDynFileDeps</i> is just a helper class from <i>xbuild/callbacks.py</i>. Check this file for other pre-implemented callback
methods.</p>

<h3>Feeding 2 tasks by 1 generator (example for <i>dynFileDepFetcher</i>)</h3>

<p>
Here the generator generates <i>.txt</i> and <i>.json</i> files. The required outputs are:
<ul>
<li><i>out/txtInfo.txt</i> - contains the size of each <i>.txt</i> files.</li>
<li><i>out/jsonInfo.txt</i> - contains the number of lines for each <i>.json</i> files.</li>
</ul>
The generator provides <i>(providedFiles)</i> <i>.size</i> files for each <i>.txt</i> files and <i>.lines</i> files for each
<i>.json</i> files. The <i>.size</i> file contains the size of the source <i>.txt</i> file, the <i>.lines</i> file contains
the number of lines in the source <i>.json</i> file.
The generator's <i>taskFactory</i> creates tasks for <i>.txt</i> to <i>.size</i> and for <i>.json</i> to <i>.lines</i> transformations.
Task <i>concatLinesFiles</i> uses a <i>dynFileDepFetcher</i> to fetch all provided <i>.lines</i> files from task <i>generator</i> and
executes <i>concatAction</i> to produce <i>out/jsonInfo.txt</i>. Task <i>concatSizeFiles</i> uses a <i>dynFileDepFetcher</i> to fetch
all provided <i>.size</i> files from task <i>generator</i> and executes <i>concatAction</i> to produce <i>out/txtInfo.txt</i>.
