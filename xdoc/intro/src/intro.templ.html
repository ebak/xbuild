<h1>xbuild introduction</h1>
<i>xbuild</i> is inspired by <a href="http://pydoit.org">pydoit</a>. Unfortunately pydoit is not really able to handle
<a href="https://github.com/pydoit/doit/issues/127">code generators</a>. <i>xbuild</i>'s main aim is to keep the simplicity of
<i>pydoit</i> and to provide a solution for the code generators.

<p><i>xbuild</i> provides a minimalistic API. Contrary to <i>scons</i> or <i>make</i> it doesn't provide any high level patterns
and gypsy-magics like pattern rules or environments.
<i>xbuild</i> is python based. Python is a feature rich and popular scripting language, which allows you to programatically build up the
dependency graph in many different ways. It has also thousands of useful, easy to use modules which can help a lot. With <i>xbuild</i>
you can use your own patterns for your build system.</p>

<p>In <i>xbuild</i> the main dependency graph entity is the <b>Task</b>. A <i>task</i> may have <i>targets</i> and <i>dependencies</i>.
<i>Targets</i> are always files. The <i>dependencies</i> can be files or other <i>Tasks</i>.The <i>Task</i> constructor has two basic
arguments which accepts functions, these are the <i>upToDate</i> and <i>action</i> arguments. <ul><li><i>upToDate</i> is executed when the
<i>Task</i> is requested and all of its dependencies are up-to-date. It must return <i>True</i> when the task is up-to-date, or
<i>False</i> when it is not up-to-date. In case of error it must return with an <i>int</i> or throw an <i>Exception</i></li>
<li><i>action</i> is executed when the <i>Task</i> is requested and it is up-to-date (dependencies are up-to-date and the
<i>upToDate</i> function returned <i>True</i>). It must do the "real stuff", like compilation, linking, etc. It must return <i>0</i>
on success or a non-zero <i>int</i> in case of error.</li></ul></p>

<p>The main API class is the <b>Builder</b>. Here are its most important functions:
</p>

<h2>Simple example for concatenating files.</h2>

<p>Note that the file system is accessed via the <i>fs</i> object. It makes possible easy mocking and mapping non file system resources
as file system resources in <i>python</i> level.</p>
<p>Here is the visual representation of the example task.</p>

<h2>Code generator tasks</h2>

<h3>Simple case</h3>
<p>The generated code is used directly by the parent task.</p>

<!-- include: gen0.html -->

<p>Here is the visual representation of the dependency graph. Note that the generated files are not directly depending on
task <i>all</i>. Task <i>all</i> fetches the generated files from the <i>generator</i> task. In other words, the generator
doesn't inject the generated files between itself and its parent tasks into the dependency graph. This makes possible simple
internal implementation.</p>
<img src="gen0.png"/>
<p>Note that the dependency graph doesn't show that which generated files are fetched by task <i>all</i>. It may be worked around by
careful generator task layering. E.g. there could be an other generator task between task <i>all</i> and task <i>generator</i>. The
intermediate generator task would just mirror those generated files which are fetched by task <i>all</i>. This concept is not yet
tested and documented.</p>
<p>If a generator generates a lot of unused temporary files (garbage) that would slow down the up-to-date checks and would result
ugly/bloated PlantUML generation. In the future it would worth to register only the useful files as <i>generatedFiles</i> and register
the remaining files as <i>garbage</i>. <i>garbage</i> would be considered only at <i>clean</i> execution.</p>

<h3>More complex case</h3>
<p>The generated code needs some compilation before it is used by the parent task. E.g. the generator creates <i>.c</i> files, bud the parent
task (e.g. linker) needs compiled  <i>.o</i> files. In this case the generator task needs to fill the <i>providedFiles</i> field with the
<i>.o</i> files. At task creation the <i>taskFactory</i> argument have to be passed. <i>taskFactory</i> is a reference to a function
which must return a list of tasks for building the provided files.</p>
<p>In the following example the generator creates <i>.txt</i> files. Its parent task creates a file which contains the size of every
<i>.txt</i> files. For this the generator task will provide <i>.size</i> files for every <i>.txt</i> files. The <i>.size</i> files
are built by tasks which are created by the generator's <i>taskFactory</i> argument.</p>

<h3>Layering generator tasks</h3>

<p>A generator can generate many kind of files. And the different kind of files need to be supplied for different kind of parent tasks.
For example a generator can generate <i>.c</i> and <i>.json</i> files. One parent task is a linker, it needs the compiled <i>.o</i>
files, the other parent task is a document builder and that needs <i>.xml</i> files built from the <i>.json</i> files.</p>

<p>One simple solution for this is to use only one generator task with a <i>taskFactory</i> which creates tasks both for the
<i>.o</i> and <i>.xml</i> files. The two parent tasks could fetch the required <i>providedFiles</i> by filtering for file extensions.
It would work, but it would be slow at partial builds and it would provide less readable UML. For example when only the linker task
is requested, that would execute the generator which would involve the compilation not only for the <i>.c</i> files but for the
<i>.json</i> files too. (This is how currently <i>xbuild</i> works, when a task action sets the <i>providedFiles</i> field, those
files are built before the task is marked as completed.)</p>

<p>Layering is better. In that case the main generator task, let's call it <i>mainGenerator</i>, would only do the generation and
would only set the <i>generatedFiles</i> field. There would be other 2 generator tasks which would depend on <i>mainGenerator</i>, let's
call them <i>objGenerator</i> and <i>xmlGenerator</i>. <i>objGenerator</i> would fetch the generated <i>.c</i> files from
<i>mainGenerator</i>, set the <i>providedFiles</i> field with the corresponding <i>.o</i> files and would create the necessary build
tasks via its <i>taskFactory</i>. <i>xmlGenerator</i> would do the same for the <i>.json</i> files. The linker task would depend on
<i>objGenerator</i>, the document builder task would depend on <i>xmlGenerator</i>. This way partial build wouldn't cause unnecessary
build steps.</p>

<p>TODO: write about the example.</p>
