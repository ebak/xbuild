Done:
- consider providedFiles and providedTasks in targetUpToDate (providedTasks are not yet handled)
- save and load lot more task data, would be good for cleaning
- more intelligent DB save:
	- it has to be updated, not to re-made, because build of a top level target shouldn't clean up the DB
	  of other, previously built targets 
- more tests:
	- task dep test
	- test when more tasks depends on the same file/task
- use sets in tasks instead of lists. Note: dependency order is important (e.g. for linker), that cannot be stored in set
- task have to fail at hash calculation when some of its generated or target files are missing
- consider generatedFiles in targetUpToDate

TODO:
- there is still race condition, see example_gen2.py
- file path mapper e.g. /home/endre/prg/tools/vsc/vsc.jar <-> {vsc}/vsc.jar
- logger based console printing
- more tests
	- test when generator provides an other generator
- pre build consistency check, cyclic dependency check, post build consistency check
- implement cleaning:
	- remove file and remove dir FS support
	- clean all
	- clean empty target directories
	- clean a target (all of its exclusive built or generated dependencies)
- handle providedTasks if needed
